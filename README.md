## 🎯 Problem

Although the ID renewal service in Absher is designed to make the process faster and easier, many users — especially the elderly and those less familiar with technology — struggle to meet the strict photo requirements.  
Photos often get **rejected without explanation**, forcing users to repeatedly upload new ones or visit a photo studio or service branch in person.

## 💡 Solution

This system uses **artificial intelligence and computer vision** to automatically:
- 🧠 **Detect violations** such as face coverings, improper attire, or invalid backgrounds.  
- 🧩 **Process and adjust the image** to meet ID photo standards — correct dimensions, centered face, and a clean white background — *without altering facial features or generating synthetic faces*.  
- 📋 **Provide instant feedback** explaining the reason for rejection (e.g., mask detected, low resolution, incorrect attire).  

As a result, users can easily correct issues before submitting their ID photo, reducing rejections and eliminating unnecessary in-person visits.
